# MVVM_RX
## Implementing MVVM using RxJava, Retrofit and DataBinding ##

Like other architectural patterns, the good way to organize your code is to use the 'MVVM' pattern. The Model, View, ViewModel (MVVM pattern) helps us to organize and structure our code. The result of this is, the model drives as many of the operations as possible, minimizing the logic in the view. In the final, the code becomes maintainable, testable and extensible applications.

This code is demonstration of,
* MVVM
* RxJava
* Retrofit
* Databinding.
* Glide
* Kotlin

The final goal is, to zip the result of two api and show the result on recycler view.
